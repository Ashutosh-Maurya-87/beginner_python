# what is class in python ?
 * Python is an object-oriented programming language that offers classes, which are a very important tool for writing     reusable code. 

 * A class is a user-defined data type that contains both, the data and the methods itself,  that may be used to manipulate it.


 # what is object ?
 * Object is the blue print of class.An object is a particular instance of a class with unique characteristics and functions

# Self parameter in python

* The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class and is used to access 
variable that belongs to the class

It must be provied as the extra parameter inside the method defination


# Class Attributes
* When we design a class, we use instance variables and class variables.

# Tow type of class attributes
* Class Variables
* Instance Variables

# Class Variables
* A class variable is a variable that is declared inside of class, but outside of any instance method or __init__() method.

# Instance Variables
* The instance variables are attributes attached to an instance of a class. We define instance variables in the constructor ( the __init__() method of a class).

# CONSTRUCTOR
* Constructors in Python is a special class method for creating and initializing an object instance at that class. Every Python class has a constructor; it's not required to be defined explicitly. The purpose of the constructor is to construct an object and assign a value to the object's members.
