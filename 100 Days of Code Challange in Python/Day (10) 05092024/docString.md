# docString
* In python docString are string i.e. used to write after the definition of the function, method, class or module.
* They are used to document our code.
* We can access these docstring using the _doc_ attribute

# Difference between docString and comment
* if we write anything in inside the comma (''') just after the function definition then that is docstring
* if we write anythin inside the comma ('''), but not just after the function definition then that is comment
