# tuple in python
* Tuple: Tuples are defined by enclosing the 
        elements in parentheses (()) instead of square brackets ([]).
    2. Tuples are immutable means we can not alter them after creation
    3. Tuple are order collection of data item. This store multiple item in single variable

* if we write tuple = (2) then python convert this is 'int' type then python did not find that is tuple.
  so overcome this problem we write an comma after the value
    tuple = (2,) now python will find that is tuple type.
