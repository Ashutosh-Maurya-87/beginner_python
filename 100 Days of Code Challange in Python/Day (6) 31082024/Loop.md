# for ... in ... loop

# range() funtion
* The range() function generates a sequence of numbers from start up to stop, and increments by step.
* range(start,stop,step)

# Else in for Loop
* Python allows an optional else clause at the end of a for loop. 
* The else clause will be executed if the loop terminates naturally (through exhaustion).
* Means if for loop excuted then after that else block is excuted
