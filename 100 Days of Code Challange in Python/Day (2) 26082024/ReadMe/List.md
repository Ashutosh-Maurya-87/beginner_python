what is list in Pytho?
 List are order collection of data items. It store multiple data itmes in a single variable.
 We can alter list after creation Means list are changale.
 List item are seprated by commas and enclose with [] this braces.

 ex-> listName = ['ashu',1,4,5,4]

 we can print all the list by using
 print(listName)   or

 print(listName[:])
       
       if we want to skip first item from the list

       then we write 
       print(listName[1:])
       
listName[start index or zero index : end index]

listName[start index or zero index : end index : jump index]

jump index is optional, if we write jump index in the list to print the list 
  then it jumps that given count from the list
